hi this is demo1 txt.
i am editing this file in branch file.
first commit is done.
what i understood is, first we will have one main file  that one others will copy as new branches, and then do changes in those branches. and commit changes into those branches
then when we want those changes in our main branch, we go back to main / master/ default branch 
and then we go to pull request
and then we can compare the branch and main file
and then if ok we can click on merge request. if not ok i dont know waht to do .. may be we wont click on merge.
so taking the positive case where we clicked on merge request. now the changes will be there in main branch also
we can then delete the branch by clicking on all branches info
